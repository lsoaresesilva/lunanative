# Summary

Luna is a cross-platform framework for mobile development in Lua programming.
With Luna you create your entire application in Lua and it will be compiled to native code (iOS or Android).

When you write:

```lua
local myButton = Button({text="Hello world!"})
```

It generates an UIButton on iOS or a Button on Android, it's fantastic!

# F.A.Q
* What is Luna?

Luna is a opensource project created by Leonardo Soares, professor at Federal Institute of Technology in Brazil. 
Luna enables the creation of mobile app only using Lua programming language.

We have some demands which you can find in our roadmap, just send a message and lets talk about this project!
